            Karachi has a tropical semi arid climate (Köppen: BSh; Trewartha: BShb),
            albeit a moderate version of this climate, influenced by monsoons.
            Karachi has a tropical climate, despite being located slightly above the
            Tropic of Cancer. It is situated in the monsoon region of Pakistan. It
            is located on the coast bordering the Arabian Sea, and as a result, has
            a relatively mild climate. However, in more recent years, rainfall has
            become more abundant, with annual rainfall projected to reach over 500
            mm by 2100. For this reason, the city may be classed as almost semi-arid
            (BSh), since it has a mild climate with a short but defined wet season,
            along with a lengthy dry season. Karachi has two main seasons; summer
            and winter, while spring and autumn are very short. The Summer season
            persists for the longest period during the year. Karachi also receives
            the rains from late June to mid-September (Monsoon).
